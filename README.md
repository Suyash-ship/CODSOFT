CODSOFT: Data Science Projects
Welcome to the CODSOFT repository, which contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate data science projects. These projects focus on predictive modeling using real-world datasets and machine learning algorithms. The repository includes three key projects:

Titanic Survival Prediction
Movie Rating Prediction
Iris Flower Classification

[Project 3: Iris Flower Classification]
Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Files:
titanic_model.py: Code to preprocess the Titanic dataset and build a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict survival.
Titanic-Dataset.csv: Dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic.
Steps:
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
Train a machine learning model using Random Forest.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
Output:
Predict whether a passenger survived based on the input features.
Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using features like genre, director, and actors. It employs regression techniques to estimate user or critic ratings for movies.

Files:
movie_rating_prediction.py: Code to preprocess movie data, encode categorical features, and train a machine learning model using Random Forest Regressor.
IMDb Movies India.csv: Dataset containing historical movie information such as genres, directors, actors, and ratings.
Steps:
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features (genre, director, actors), and feature selection.
Train a regression model to predict movie ratings.
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
Output:
Predict the rating of a movie based on its genre, director, and actors.
Project 3: Iris Flower Classification
The classic Iris Flower Classification project involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on features like petal length, sepal width, etc.

Files:
iris_classifier.py: Code to build and train a machine learning classifier (Random Forest) on the Iris dataset.
Iris-Dataset.csv: The well-known Iris dataset containing features of different iris flowers.
Steps:
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the data (if necessary).
Train a classification model using Random Forest.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall.
Output:
Predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.
