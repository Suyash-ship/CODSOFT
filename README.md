# CODSOFT: Data Science Projects

Welcome to the **CODSOFT** repository, which contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate data science projects. These projects focus on predictive modeling using real-world datasets and machine learning algorithms. The repository includes three key projects:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
2. **Movie Rating Prediction**
3. **Iris Flower Classification**

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the famous **Titanic dataset** to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

### Files:
- `titanic_model.py`: Code to preprocess the Titanic dataset and build a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict survival.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic.

### Steps:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
3. Train a machine learning model using Random Forest.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Output:
- Predict whether a passenger survived based on the input features.

## Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction

This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using features like genre, director, and actors. It employs regression techniques to estimate user or critic ratings for movies.

### Files:
- `movie_rating_prediction.py`: Code to preprocess movie data, encode categorical features, and train a machine learning model using Random Forest Regressor.
- `IMDb Movies India.csv`: Dataset containing historical movie information such as genres, directors, actors, and ratings.

### Steps:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features (genre, director, actors), and feature selection.
3. Train a regression model to predict movie ratings.
4. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

### Output:
- Predict the rating of a movie based on its genre, director, and actors.

## Project 3: Iris Flower Classification

The classic **Iris Flower Classification** project involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on features like petal length, sepal width, etc.

### Files:
- `iris_classifier.py`: Code to build and train a machine learning classifier (Random Forest) on the Iris dataset.
- `Iris-Dataset.csv`: The well-known Iris dataset containing features of different iris flowers.

### Steps:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (if necessary).
3. Train a classification model using Random Forest.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Output:
- Predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.
